# NixOS

**configuration.nix**
**flake.nix**
**home.nix**

Must need to be in **/etc/nixos/** (Tips, be in sudo cause these file are not writable in user mode)
also don't forget to change the username and the machine name (vaelen is the username and foxdroid is the machine name)

# Niri (Wayland)
**config.kdl** in the niri folder must be place in **~/.config/niri/**
also reminder to change the output in the file, the resolution and framerate (also the keyboard, i use caps lock to change the layout between french, english and russian)

# Mako (Notification)
This is my style, this file must be place in **~/.config/mako/**
